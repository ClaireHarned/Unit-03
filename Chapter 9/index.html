                The year 2020 was a unique year for migration in the 
                European Union (EU) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
                pandemic's impact on international and domestic mobility
                 was significant, resulting in several travel restrictions 
                 and mobility limitations. Consequently, the movement of people 
                 in EU countries in 2020 differed from the usual trends. There 
                 was a substantial decrease in international migration, while 
                 domestic migration increased in some EU countries. There were several 
                 disaster-related internal displacements in EU countries in 2020, 
                 as extreme weather events such as floods and storms forced many people to flee 
                 their homes. Additionally, the pandemic had a profound impact on refugees
                 and asylum seekers, making their movements even more challenging. 
                 Understanding the numbers and patterns of moving people in EU countries 
                 in 2020 is crucial to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the 
                 pandemic's impact on migration and human mobility in the region.
                 This map and graph demonstrates the patterns of these moving peoples throughout each 
                 EU country (excluding Sweden) and shows the differences of numbers within each category 
                 of moving people.
